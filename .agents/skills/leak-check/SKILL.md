# Leak Check

Scan OpenClaw session JSONL files for leaked credentials. Reports which real AI provider (anthropic, openai, google, etc.) received the data, skipping internal delivery echoes.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Check for leaked credentials (default: discord format)
node scripts/leak-check.js

# JSON output
node scripts/leak-check.js --format json
```

## Configuration

Credentials to check are defined in `leak-check.json`. The script searches for this file in order:

1. **Skill directory** (`./leak-check.json`) — for backward compatibility
2. **`~/clawd/leak-check.json`** — recommended persistent location (survives skill updates via clawhub)

Since clawhub clears the skill directory on updates, place your config in `~/clawd/` to avoid losing it:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/clawd
cp leak-check.json ~/clawd/leak-check.json
```

You can also specify an explicit path with `--config`.

```json
[
  { "name": "Discord", "search": "abc*xyz" },
  { "name": "Postmark", "search": "k7Qm9x" }
]
```

**Important:** Do not store full credentials in this file. Use only a partial fragment — enough to uniquely identify the credential via a contains, begins-with, or ends-with match.

**Wildcard patterns:**
- `abc*` — starts with "abc"
- `*xyz` — ends with "xyz"
- `abc*xyz` — starts with "abc" AND ends with "xyz"
- `abc` (no asterisk) — contains "abc"
- `""` (empty) — skip this credential

## Options

- `--format <type>` — Output format: `discord` (default) or `json`
- `--config <path>` — Path to credential config file (default: `./leak-check.json`, then `~/clawd/leak-check.json`)
- `--help`, `-h` — Show help message

## Output

### Discord (Default)

```
🔐 **Credential Leak Check**

⚠️ **2 leaked credentials found**

**Discord Token**
• Session: `abc12345` | 2026-02-14 18:30 UTC | Provider: anthropic

**Postmark**
• Session: `def67890` | 2026-02-10 09:15 UTC | Provider: anthropic
```

Or if clean:

```
🔐 **Credential Leak Check**
✅ No leaked credentials found (checked 370 files, 7 credentials)
```

### Config Echoes

If the `leak-check.json` config file is read or discussed during an OpenClaw session, the credential patterns will appear in that session's JSONL log. The scanner detects this and reports these matches separately as **config echoes** rather than real leaks:

```
📋 **3 possible config echoes** (session contains leak-check config)

• **Discord**: 1 session
...

✅ No credential leaks beyond config echoes
```

Config echoes will continue to appear on every run until the session file is removed. To clear them, delete the session file from `~/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/`:

```bash
rm ~/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/<session-uuid>.jsonl
```

**Tip:** Avoid reading or referencing `leak-check.json` during an OpenClaw session. If it happens, note the session ID from the report and delete it.
