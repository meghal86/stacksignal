# task-resume

Automatic interrupted-task resume workflow for OpenClaw agents.

`task-resume` solves a common execution failure: important tasks get interrupted by new requests and never get resumed. This skill adds a deterministic queue + recovery pattern so an agent can finish the current interrupting task and then automatically resume previously interrupted work.

---

## Why this skill exists

In real assistant workflows, context switching is unavoidable:

- A priority task is in progress
- A user asks something else in the middle
- The agent switches focus
- The original task gets dropped

`task-resume` prevents this by enforcing:

1. **Interruption detection**
2. **State capture into a queue**
3. **Automatic resume after current task completion**
4. **FIFO recovery order + deduplication**

---

## Core capabilities

- Queue interrupted tasks with:
  - title
  - context (done + exact next step)
  - acceptance criteria
  - source channel/session
- Pop and resume oldest interrupted task (FIFO)
- Deduplicate near-identical repeated interruptions
- List and clear queue for operations/debugging
- Persist queue to workspace memory file

Queue file:

- `memory/task-resume-queue.json`

## Command interface

### Add interrupted task

```bash
python3 skills/task-resume/scripts/task_resume_queue.py add \
  --title "<task title>" \
  --context "<done + exact next step>" \
  --acceptance "<acceptance criteria>" \
  --source "<session/channel>"
```

### Pop oldest task (resume target)

```bash
python3 skills/task-resume/scripts/task_resume_queue.py pop
```

### List queue

```bash
python3 skills/task-resume/scripts/task_resume_queue.py list
```

### Clear queue

```bash
python3 skills/task-resume/scripts/task_resume_queue.py clear
```

## Recommended policy

Treat these user commands as explicit override (do **not** auto-resume):

- `cancel`
- `pause`
- `change priority`
- `do it tomorrow`

Everything else can be considered a temporary interruption candidate.

---

## Operational guardrails

- Never drop queued tasks silently
- Always capture a precise next step when enqueueing
- Deduplicate identical title + context pairs
- Keep queue bounded (default implementation max: 30)
- Avoid storing sensitive secrets in queue content

---

## Validation performed

Stress test completed with 3 consecutive interruptions:

- enqueue A, B, C
- repeat B (dedup check)
- pop x3

Observed behavior:

- dedup worked (`updated`, queue count unchanged)
- resume order preserved (A → B → C)
- queue emptied correctly

---

## Use cases

- Long-form doc editing with frequent side interruptions
- Multi-step delivery pipelines with strict acceptance criteria
- Assistants operating across chat groups + DMs
- Task continuity in noisy real-world conversation streams
